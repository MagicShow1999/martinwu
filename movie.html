	<h1>Movie is fun and fascinating.</h1>
	<p>One of my hobbies is watching movies while I have nothing to do. I love different genres of movies including action, love, thrilling, and fiction. My favorite movie is <em>Pulp Fiction.</em>

	<p>Whenever there are some new movies on the show, I'll go to <a class="externallink" href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDb</a> to look for some reviews about that movie and decide whether it worths a movie ticket to watch. I believe IMDb is one of the most objective movie review websites and it also provides information about cast, actors and plot.
